    "In the real world, with fierce competitors ready to attack *BalancedMilk*'s market share, the cost of not supplying milk to a demand center is not zero. Additionally, like Problem 2, the firm should supply all the milk provided by the remaining seven supply centers. Suppose the cost of not delivering each tonne of milk to each demand center is  20\\\\$/tone. Formulate the problem of minimizing the sum of total transportation and not supplying costs using Gurobi and solve it. Then, report the optimal allocation and the minimum cost. Now suppose instead of 20\\\\$/tone, the not supplying cost is 100\\$/tone. Again, formulate the problem of minimizing the sum of total transportation and not supplying costs using Gurobi and solve it. Then, report the optimal allocation and the minimum cost. \n",

However, when that same not-supplying cost is at 100 dollars, our optimal cost function takes the value of 54,670.00 dollars, same value as in problem 3 where supplying the whole stock was a necessity. \n",

But when it's at 100 dollars, it is more expensive to not deliver milk as their sale price is higher than delivery. Therefore, they would prefer delivering their whole stock and we'd be back to our previous scenario."
